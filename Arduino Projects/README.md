# ARDUINO PROJECTS:

### Below are the projects I have worked on in Hardware and Prototyping in Modeling and Simulation. The hardware used was the huzzah32 from adafruit and the software was primarily Arduino. I would like to mention I have installed MicroPython on the board and begun experimenting with it. My Ultimate goal is to develop a platform for IOT that uses Machine Learning technqiues and possibly in a Reinforcement Learning Environment. 
#### Temp_Sensor: Reads digital temperature and humidity and displays it on the TFT MiniWing from adafruit that is a stackable board mini LCD for the huzzah32. 
##### TOF_Sensor: The TOF sensors dives deeper in the structure needed for a multi page reading display using Distance and Lux measurements via I2C.
