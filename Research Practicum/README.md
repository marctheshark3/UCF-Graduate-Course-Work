## Abstract 

The Attention Restoration Theory or ART has been shown in several studies that positive effects of nature and/or nature scenes can have on measured attention and even stress. In these studies, the researchers use commonly 15 minutes for the participants. 
The aim of the research study will be to explore the minimal exposure time in regards to the Attention Restoration Theory (ART) using Virtual Reality (VR). At this stage research in ART has shown the positive effects that nature and/or nature scenes can have on measure attention, but in these studies the researchers arbitrarily decided the exposure time. During experimentation the data being collected will by the following validated assessment tools: the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ), the n-back assessment where n=2 , and Vigilance Test TOAV (Test of Attentional Vigilance). 

The process in which the data will be collected from the assessments is as follows: 

DSSQ, 2-back, Vigilance Test, DSSQ (mood only) , 2-back, Break with/without Nature Scenes under VR, 2-back, and finally DSSQ again. 

The quantitative themes we expect correspond to the exposure time relative to the Vigilance test, where there will be a better score in the final 2-back test after the participants views the nature under VR. These assessments are a combination of qualitative (surveys) and quantitative data, and will be analyzed using the programming tool R. The qualitative themes correspond to the surveys given to the participants to determine their perceptions of the present moment and their moods where we are expecting to gather a base line of emotions and see a change in emotional response as the experiment is unfolding. The practical applications of this study are connected to peoples every day lives. 

Everything today is extremely faced paced with data and information everywhere. Too much information can overload our systems, and as a result stresses us out. There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. Many people of today have developed many methods coping with stress and their ability to pay attention at the task at hand. Understanding the time it takes for one attention restoration will plays a huge role in productivity and mental stability. Knowing that nature invokes a restorative response is not enough in todays faced paced world. Therefore it is of importance to determine the general time it takes for someone’s attention to be restored.  

## Introduction

Everything today is extremely faced paced with data and information everywhere. Too much information can overload our systems, and as a result stresses us out. There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. Many people of today have developed many methods coping with stress and their ability to pay attention at the task at hand. Understanding the time it takes for one attention restoration will plays a huge role in productivity and mental stability. The Attention Restoration Theory or ART has been shown in several studies that positive effects of nature and/or nature scenes can have on measured attention and even stress. In these studies the researchers use commonly 15 minutes for the participants. Knowing that nature invokes a restorative response is not enough in todays faced paced world. Therefore it is of importance to determine the general time it takes for someone’s attention to be restored.  

In order to solve problems, deliver outstanding work or just to work focused and concentrated on a task requires to voluntarily direct attention. According to Kaplan (1995) and his Attention Restoration Theory (ART), this focus of attention, the deliberate mental activity in the face of (negatively impacting) distraction requires effort and is susceptible to fatigue. Directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and achievements and therefore its fatigue can have severe consequences (e.g. airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, brain surgeons). Several studies based on ART have shown the positive effects that nature and/or nature scenes can have on measured attention and even stress. In one of the latest studies, performed by Anderson et al. (2017), significant positive attention restoration was measured after 15 minutes exposures to different nature scenes (Ireland, Beach) compared to the control scene results. The observation of "voluntary attention", its effects and needs were first described by William James (1892). Since then the theory and research have been on hold until about 1985. Most current research was done by Stephen Kaplan. A study in 2008 by Marc Berman, John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan validated the Attention Restoration Theory which states that interacting with nature will restore ones ability to focus specifically direct attention. The hypothesis was that walking in nature or looking at a photo of nature will improve directed-attention abilities. The walk in nature lasted between 50 and 55 minutes and the picture viewing session lasted 10 minutes. The authors concluded that they “can be confident that directed-attention mechanisms were restored in these studies because only portions of the ANT that involved directed attention were improved by interactions with nature”[Berman].

The 2008 study was indeed meant for validation of ART. Their study indeed did this yet we are interested in the time it takes for once attention to be restored. Specifically in their experiment 2 when participants viewed either urban photos or nature photos that session lasted 10 minutes. Is it possibly for the same result in a smaller amount of time, or will we see a change.

Today's proposed solutions are pairing this theory with VR methodology, since VR is becoming more accessible. Additionally, VR's immersive environment could effect attention restoration in positive ways by simulation Nature in VR. There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. But it has much broader real live implications. Directed or focused attention is needed for most of our daily activities, even in the university as a student. While not being vital per definition, the ability to work in a concentrated fashion to deliver outstanding work decides over students’ grades and therefore also at least partly over their/our future. Recovery from directed attention fatigue restores effectiveness, which will have an immediate impact of the overall, general live situation (better, more effective time management). Improving effectiveness, restoring focus and improving the ability to inhibit distractions is self explanatory. Additionally, other studies have not looked at the timing it takes for one to relax, just in the variables themselves. From previous studies the ART method has been validated, and so the next question is how long does it take for one to be in a relaxed state. In the context of restoring attention and relieving stress, viewing or immersing in nature has repeatedly shown positive effects. Our research aims at validating/reconstructing some of the more recent research by using nature scenes under Virtual Reality.

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)

In order to solve problems, deliver outstanding work or just to work focused and concentrated on a task requires to voluntarily direct attention. According to Kaplan (1995) and his Attention Restoration Theory (ART), this focus of attention, the deliberate mental activity in the face of (negatively impacting) distraction requires effort and is susceptible to fatigue. Directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and achievements and therefore its fatigue can have severe consequences (e.g. airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, brain surgeons).

Several studies based on ART have shown the positive effects that nature and/or nature scenes can have on measured attention and even stress. In one of the latest studies, performed by Anderson et al. (2017), significant positive attention restoration was measured after 15 minutes exposures to different nature scenes (Ireland, Beach) compared to the control scene results.

(Add real-world examples, if any)

There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. But it has much broader real live implications. Directed or focused attention is needed for most of our daily activities, even in the university as a student. While not being vital per definition, the ability to work in a concentrated fashion to deliver outstanding work decides over students’ grades and therefore also at least partly over their/our future. Recovery from directed attention fatigue restores effectiveness, which will have an immediate impact of the overall, general live situation (better, more effective time management).

(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The observation of "voluntary attention", its effects and needs were first descibed by William James (1892). Since then the theory and research have been on hold until about 1985. Most current research was done by Stephen Kaplan. One of the latest studies by Berman aim to validated the Attention Restoration Theory in Nature where participants in nature or viewing pictures of nature reduced their direct attention levels. Today's proposed solutions are pairing this theory with VR methodology, since VR is becoming more accessible. Additionally VR's immersive environment could effect attention restoration in positive ways by simulation Nature in VR.

(I tell students to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)
Everything today is extremely faced paced with data and information everywhere. Too much information can overload our systems, and as a result stresses us out. This stress can result from the inability to focus and people of today have developed many methods coping with stress and their ability to pay attention at the task at hand. Studies have shown that when participants surround themselves in Nature or view photos of Nature, this restores the users attention abilities compared to urban areas. This study aims to finding an optimal time when participants view nature settings under VR. 

Acknowledging that directed attention is highly important and that this process is suspectible to fatigue, how can it be restored?

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

Improving effectiveness, restoring focus and improving the ability to inhibit distractions is self explanatory. Additionally other studies have not looked at the timing it takes for one to relax, just in the variables themselves. From previous studies the ART method has been validated, and so the next question is how long does it take for one to be in a relaxed state.

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

In the context of restoring attention and relieving stress, viewing or immersing in nature has repeatedly shown positive effects. Our research aims at validating/reconstructing some of the more recent research by using nature scenes under Virtual Reality.    

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)
This project makes the following contributions:
- Analyzing the difference in nature relaxation times under VR, specfically looking at 10 min and 15 min. Given the time, the effects of further reduction of exposure time will be studied. 

## Related Work

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

The article under review was The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting with Nature by Marc Berman, John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan in the journal of Psychological Science. The purpose of this experiment was to validate the Attention Restoration Theory which states that interacting with nature will restore ones ability to focus specifically direct attention. The authors hypothesis was that walking in nature or looking at a photo of nature will improve directed-attention abilities.

The design of the experimentation was simple pre assessment then for experiment 1 the participants were either told to go for a walk in the downtown area or walk in the arboretum on the universities campus for 50-55 minutes. The assessments used were the PANAS and the backwards digit span assessments for the first experiments. The PANAS assessed mood, and the backwards digit span test for participants direction attention abilities. After the walk the participants were given the backwards digit span task again. Once the final assessment was over the participants returned a week later and performed the same experiment again.

Alternatively another experiment was performed with slightly different design. The only different was the that the backwards digit span assessment wasn’t used to measure direct attention abilities, rather the Attention Network Test (ANT). This assessment measures the participants executive, alerting, and orientating functions. Additionally instead of walking through either an urban area or in nature, the participants were shown either urban or nature scene photos.

This study accomplished its objectives and can be seen from the experiment results. In experiment 1 as participants in the natural setting vastly improved their results after their walk vs the urban setting participants. Additionally in experiments 2 the authors repeated the studies in experiment 1 and the results were replicated. Lastly the ANT measures show that after the participants view photos of natural settings their executive cognitions increase. This is because directed attention involves executive tasks and can be restored through ART methods.The authors concluded that they “can be confident that directed-attention mechanisms were restored in these studies because only portions of the ANT that involved directed attention were improved by interactions with nature”. They also noted each of the experiments showed “consistent improvement on the backwards digit-span task as a function of interactions with nature”.

Another report discusses the results of a study conducted using Attention Restoration Theory (ART) delivered through Virtual Reality (VR), 18 subjects took part in this study, 9 males and 9 females between the ages of 20 and 44. During this study, a head mounted display device such as the Oculus VR was used to immerse the subjects into three different scenes, one rural scene without any nature settings and two other nature scenes. This study posed 2 hypotheses, the first one claimed that nature scenes can reduce stress better than non-nature scenes, while the second hypothesis stated that the preference of the nature scene will have more restorative results than the other nature scene. Several devices were used to record stress level activity, questionnaires were also used to assess the perception the subject’s perception of their own stress level. During the experiment the subjects wore the monitoring the devices to create a baseline, then a timed math test was provided to induce a certain stress level on the subjects, after raising the stress level, the subjects were placed under the VR scenes for 15 minutes. This process was repeated again with all of the other scenes and the order of the scenes were randomized. The monitoring devices recorded stress level throughout the whole experiment, while the questionnaires were provided to the subject before and after the VR sessions. The study produced results in accordance with the first hypothesis. The subject displayed and expressed that after being stressed, the natural scene relieved stress more significantly than the non-nature scene. On the other hand, the second hypothesis did not show a significant difference between the nature scene of choice and the other nature scene according to the monitoring sensors, but according to the perception of the subjects it did.

	
## Research Methods
Since the subject is interdisciplinary by design, there are certain areas in which each member has only very limited knowledge about. 
The first step of our research was a rough literature research about the different topics and for related and similar work and studies. This led to the current research question, resulting in our research approach and design.  

We have chosen a quantitative approach to generate and analyze data.

Our methods and experimental design will focus on generating and gathering quantitative data. We have chosen this approach because we believe quantitative data is easier and more comprehensive to be collected, analyzed, interpreted and visualized. Additionally, the related work has shown that qualitative data is not needed to measure/generate the intended data.

Our research question is: What is the minimum time for viewing nature scenes to have a (measurable, significant) positive effect on attention restoration, as described in the Attention Restoration Theory (ART).

#### Our experiment will be structured as following:

![Timeline](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/PictureTimeline2.jpg)

- The set up of the experiment will be explained, a short brief on all the following meausurements and the technology used (VR) will be given, the variables to be measured and taken explained in detail.


- The participant are then given 2 surveys as a baseline for their emotional state (which could be a confiding variable)
   - on their subjective stress and mood level (DSSQ)


- The participant will then perform, as the first experiment, a 2-Back Test 
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error rate
   - this is the beginning of the experiment and the results will be the baseline for all further measurements. 
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)


- It will be directly followed by the Test of Attentional Vigilance (TOAV), requiring high concentration levels to be successful to deplete attention from the participant
   - the intention of these tests is to wear/tire the attentive capability of the participant
   - the results will be recorded and will be given to the participant, but they will only be used in the experimental data to see if the test was actually successful in tiring out the participant, depleting his attentive vigilance.
   - the overall time of the testing (including the base-lining with 2-Back Test) before the break will be about 40 minutes, as a compromise between the need to tire the attention of the participant and the time available with/for each participant (volunteers). 


- The participant will then again perform a 2-Back Test as part of their tasks.
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error again, as the measurement of the effects of attention depletion on their performance levels
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)


- The participant will then 
	1. take a break of 15 min (without VR or nature scenes of any kind) 
	2. take a break with 15 min of VR nature scenes (scenes depending on the individual)
	3. take a break with 10 min of VR nature scenes (scenes depending on the individual)
   - The regular "office" chair will be given, as we focus on the visual inputs and effects, not the overall effect of comfortable sensory (touch, body position) environment.
   - An "Oculus Go" will be used, with which the participant can select his/her favorite natural environment (forrest, wood, beach, mountains) 

![Oculus Go](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/OculusGo.jpg)
Oculus Go was used in the experiment to immerse in nature scenes

- Immediately after the scene viewing, the participant will perform the 2-Back Test again
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error again, to measure the effects of possible VR attention restoration (target data!)
   - this is also the baseline for the follow up session, in which the time of VR scene viewing will be reduced (to 10 minutes)
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)
   
   
- The participant are then given the survey again (DSSQ) as measurement of their emotional state
   - on their subjective stress and mood level 

![Nature scene available-excerpt](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/GuidedVRscenes.jpg)
Several different nature scenes where available, depending on the participants disposition.


_As a prerequisite to continue the experiment, the results of the first experiment need to be analyzed to make a decision!_

_The participants will need to show positive effects on their last 2-Back Test (after the VR session).

_Otherwise the experiment has failed and needs to be re-evaluated (set-up, assumptions, execution, environment)._


- The experiment will be repeated after one week with a shorter viewing time, reducing the VR recovery from 15 min to 10 minutes.

- There will also be a control experiment with no VR session but to remain within the current (urban) environment with no "nature" settings.

In addition we plan to analyze the data using the Power Analysis or Qualtrics, possibly using code R to visualize results.


#### Results

Here are the results in graphs, with the number of mistakes (incorrect responses) and the average response time to answer.

![Results](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/Run1_results.jpg)
Trial 1: 15 minutes of break, no nature, no VR

The first run/trial was conducted with 15 minutes of a "normal" break, with no nature scene exposure. 

As for the mistakes, participant 5 and 3 actually improved their performance after the TOAV (attentive depletion) which was unexpected. We assume that to perform the n-back everybody is developing its own strategy to perform and adapt to the task. It seems that both participants overcame their problems with the n-back and were able to find a strategy that works for them. By design, the results should have decreased (increase in the graph). Looking at the response time, that seems to be confirmed for participant 5. 

Otherwise, the results are inconclusive in regard to the effect of the TOAV (attentive depletion). We cannot confirm that the TOAV actually depleted attention or tired the participants on a objective level. Neither for the incorrect responses nor the response time.



![Results](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/Run2_results.jpg)
Trial 2: 15 minutes of VR immersed nature scenes as a break

The second run/trial was conducted with 15 minutes of a nature scenes delivered by Virtual Reality (Oculus Go). The nature scenes could be chosen depending on the participant and its disposition (see above for nature scene variety). Participants 3 and 4 both did worse on the 3rd n-back than their initial nback with respect to the incorrect responses which again is unexpected. Looking at the response time participant 3 had an inverse reaction where they had a faster reaction time after the TOAV. Participants 2 and 5 response ties for trial 2 showed expected results. Both show that the particpant has low initial RT where it increases after the TOAV and later decreasing for the 3rd n-back. Yet looking at participants 2 correctness it seems that even though they were faster in the first and third n-backs that doesnt guarenteed correctness. Participants 1 and 4 achieved constant reaction times with a slight increase in the 3rd n-back. 



![Results](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/Run3_results.jpg)
Trial 3: 10 minutes of VR immersed nature scenes as a break

The third run/trial was conducted with 10 minutes of a nature scenes delivered by Virtual Reality (Oculus Go). The nature scenes could be chosen depending on the participant and its disposition (see above for nature scene variety). Simiarly to Trial 2, participant 2 responded in a similar manner. Participant 3 progressively got worse in this trial. The response time graphs show that participants 1,2,4 had a decrease in response time after the TOAV, and participant 5 having a slight increase. From the incorrect responses particpants 4 and 5 had lower mistakes in the nback after the TOAV. 


Comparing Trial 2 and Trial 3's response time some results are consistant like in participant 2. Yet in trial 3 we see more of what we are expecting to see in the data. More participants achieve fast reaction times in the 3rd n-back. This difference in the data could be caused from the VR session in trial 2 being too long and participants getting bored.

The plot below was generated to describe each participants number of incorrect responses in each nback assessment over all trials. This plot can be used to validate if the particpants attention levels have been lowered. We should ideally be seeing larger values for the 2nn n-back and lower for the first and third nback. It is interesting to note particpants 1,3, and 4 have long boxes wiskers for their 3rd nback. From the data it would seem that we successfully stressed out particpants 1,2, and 5. Additionally we see inverse results for particpant 3. Of course futher analysis is needed. 

![Results](https://github.com/MarkusLoennig/project_template/blob/master/IMAGES/mistakesBoxplot1.png)


#### Way ahead
There isnt enough particpants to see a trend whether the ART works or not. There is some sign but certainly not definitive enough to say one way or the other.There clearly isnt enough data to support the ART theory. Therefore we reject our original hypothesis: “Exposure to nature scenes through VR can measurably restore one’s attention in less than 15 minutes”. In terms of the n-back it seems that for some participants it was too easy and so we would recommend using a 3-back for higher difficulty. Further analysis is needed to be sure that ART is valid in this experimentation. For example looking at the response times per person over all of the trials. Additionally we are not sure that the TOAV actually stresses our participants. In the future we would look to other methods in lowering our particpants attention levels, higher particpant count, and a more detailed analysis of all of our gathered data. Lastly we would also like to answer new research questions like: can a break be too long? and whats the maximum regeneration of attention? As a group we learned we should of started earlier with the selection of questionaires, research experimentation, for the analysis of the gathered data. Just because someone else uses a survey doesnt mean we should. Of course we thought using the DSSQ would be useful but didnt have time to process it. Since completeting this research we now have a better understanding of what is needed for this type of venture in terms of time management and planning.
